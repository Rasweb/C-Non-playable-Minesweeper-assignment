A c assignment connected to my system developer education.
This assignment is the second i did for the c programming language. 
The assignment took its inspiration from this: "https://minesweeper.online/".
The main cpp file is "Inl√§mning 2.cpp".

Its goal was to print out and ranomize a minesweeper map. 
That should randomize atleast 30 mines on a map with this ratio: 20x10.
Can be printet out in various ways like the console and to a text file.

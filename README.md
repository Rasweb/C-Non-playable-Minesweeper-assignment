## Overview
### Minesweeper Gameboard
A C assignment connected to my system developer education.
The main cpp file is "Inl√§mning 2.cpp".
The assignment took its inspiration from this: "https://minesweeper.online/".

This assignment creates a minesweeper gameboard:
* It asks the user for width, height and the number of mines in the gameboard.
* Then it gives the user different choices to print out that gameboard.
* It can also save to a text file and load from one.

### Built With

Write the height(y: 1 - 500): 10
Write the number of mines(Less then x*y): 20
